                <p>I have worked with Aswathi for about 2+ years. those two years i have 
                  observed Aswathi is an ambitious Front end developer and a very good 
                  team player. Self motivated and very productive in the work. She used 
                  to be very clear and never settle for less when it comes to quality in 
                  the given task. She used to be very innovative and creative in the work. 
                  She played key role in all the projects that she had worked with me. 
                  Good attitude towards work and very committed resource. She is very quick 
                  learner, problem solver and eager to take more responsibilities.</p>

                  <p>I worked with Aswathi for 3 years in 2 different projects. Her technical 
                    competence along with her dedication makes her a very important asset 
                    for any Project/Team. The reason for her being such a successful Angular 
                    developer is because she gives a huge importance to thorough unit testing 
                    and constantly updating her with the latest in her technology. Even after 
                    having left the organization the team doesn't face any difficulty since 
                    Aswathi has ensured she has delivered a very good quality of code and also 
                    documented every minute aspect which in itself is sufficient even for a new 
                    developer to take her piece of code. Wishing Aswathi all success.</p>
